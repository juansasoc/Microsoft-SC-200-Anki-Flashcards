You’re triaging repeated brute-force failures against an Azure VM. You need to quickly find the top external IPs with the most failed sign-ins and see if any of them later succeeded. Which KQL pattern best fits this task?	"Use SigninLogs (or AAD sign-in table) to summarize failures by IP, then join to successes:

SigninLogs
| where ResultType != 0
| summarize Failed=count() by IPAddress
| join kind=leftouter (
    SigninLogs
    | where ResultType == 0
    | summarize Succeeded=count() by IPAddress
) on IPAddress
| order by Failed desc"	SC-200::Scenario KQL Sentinel Authentication
Multiple Defender for Endpoint alerts about suspicious PowerShell are grouped into a single case in Microsoft Sentinel. What Sentinel concept is responsible for this grouping?	Incidents — Sentinel groups related alerts into incidents so analysts can manage and investigate them collectively.	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel Incidents MDE
You want to automatically assign high severity to any incident created from a particular analytics rule and notify the on-call team in Teams. Which Sentinel features should you configure?	Use an Automation rule to set incident severity and trigger a Logic Apps playbook that posts to Microsoft Teams.	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel Automation Playbooks Teams
Your SOC needs phishing-related alerts from Microsoft 365 to arrive in Sentinel for correlation with user sign-ins. Which integration should you enable?	Enable the Microsoft 365 Defender data connector in Sentinel to stream M365 security alerts and incidents.	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel DataConnectors M365Defender
An auditor must review incidents, analytics rules, and workbooks in Sentinel but must not modify anything. Which role is most appropriate?	Microsoft Sentinel Reader — allows viewing incidents, rules, workbooks, and data without write access.	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel RBAC Roles
You need to enrich your hunting results with a small list of known suspicious domains provided by threat intel. What Sentinel feature lets you bring a simple CSV list into KQL for enrichment?	Watchlists — upload the CSV as a watchlist and reference it in KQL using _GetWatchlist().	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel Watchlists ThreatIntel
Your team wants to alert when a new high-privileged Azure AD role assignment occurs and run every 5 minutes. Which kind of Sentinel rule should you use?	A Scheduled analytics rule with a KQL query against the relevant audit/sign-in tables, set to run at 5-minute frequency.	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel AnalyticsRules Scheduled
You’re investigating lateral movement. You have DeviceLogonEvents and need to add a derived column that flags interactive logons from new remote IPs per user. Which KQL operator should you use to add the flag?	extend — use extend to create a calculated boolean (e.g., IsNewRemoteIP) after you derive first-seen IP per user with summarize/arg_min.	SC-200::Scenario KQL extend LateralMovement
You want a quick count of PowerShell execution events per host and then filter to hosts with unusually high counts compared to their peers. Which KQL construct helps you detect outliers statistically?	use summarize by host, then apply series/outlier logic or use percentile-based filtering (e.g., > percentile(Count, 95)).	SC-200::Scenario KQL Outliers Anomaly
A playbook that enriches indicators with VirusTotal fails because the analyst’s personal account lost API access. What’s a better way to authenticate for reliability and least privilege?	Use a managed identity or an Azure AD app registration (service principal) with the minimal required permissions and store secrets in Key Vault.	SC-200::Scenario Playbooks Identity KeyVault LeastPrivilege
Defender for Cloud shows your Secure Score is low due to missing MFA and endpoint protections. What feature provides prioritized hardening actions to raise the score?	Recommendations (which drive Secure Score) — enable MFA, endpoint protection, and other recommended security controls.	SC-200::Scenario DefenderForCloud SecureScore Recommendations
You notice unusual OAuth app consent grants in Microsoft 365. Which product’s alerts and investigation tools help you assess risky cloud app behavior and OAuth abuse?	Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (formerly MCAS) — use app governance and OAuth app insights/alerts.	SC-200::Scenario MDA OAuth CloudApps
A user reports device tampering. You need device timeline, evidence collection, and isolation capability. Which product provides these device-centric investigation tools?	Microsoft Defender for Endpoint — device timeline, advanced hunting, and device isolation features.	SC-200::Scenario MDE Endpoint Investigation
You suspect Kerberoasting in your environment. Which hunting approach in Sentinel can quickly identify a spike in service ticket requests per account?	Use SecurityEvent/DeviceEvents (or relevant identity logs) to summarize Kerberos TGS requests by account over time and alert on abnormal spikes.	SC-200::Scenario KQL Hunting Kerberoasting
You want to correlate sign-in failures from Azure AD with endpoint alerts from Defender for Endpoint within Sentinel to see the full attack path. What’s the most direct way?	Use a KQL join across the ingested tables (e.g., SigninLogs joined with SecurityAlert or the MDE alert table) inside a hunting query or analytics rule.	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel Correlation KQL
