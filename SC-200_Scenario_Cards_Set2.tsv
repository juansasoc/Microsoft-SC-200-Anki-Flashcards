A user’s credentials are suspected to be compromised. You need to immediately block their sign-ins across Microsoft 365 while the investigation proceeds. Which action should you take first?	In Azure AD (Entra ID), block the user’s sign-in. This prevents new sessions while preserving evidence for investigation.	SC-200::Scenario IncidentResponse Identity
During an investigation, you need to isolate an endpoint from the network but still allow it to communicate with Defender for Endpoint and remediation tools. What action should you use?	Use Device Isolation in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint — it cuts off all traffic except for Defender and management connections.	SC-200::Scenario IncidentResponse MDE Isolation
You want Sentinel to automatically detect suspicious patterns of multiple alerts from different products pointing to the same entity (user, host, or IP). Which Sentinel feature enables this?	Fusion detection rules (ML-driven correlation) — they combine signals from multiple sources to raise high-fidelity incidents.	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel Fusion ML UEBA
You need to track abnormal behavior of a privileged account over time, such as impossible travel or unusual resource access. Which Sentinel capability is best suited?	UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics) — it profiles baselines and highlights anomalies for users/entities.	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel UEBA Anomaly
While reviewing incidents, you see a Fusion ML incident that references a user entity with high anomaly scores. Where do you drill down for more context?	UEBA entity pages in Sentinel — they consolidate timelines, anomaly scores, and related alerts for the entity.	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel UEBA EntityPage
A playbook is failing because a SOC analyst modified its JSON definition in the Logic Apps designer. To prevent accidental changes, what should you implement?	Use source control (e.g., GitHub integration) and role-based access in Sentinel/Logic Apps to restrict who can edit playbooks.	SC-200::Scenario Automation Governance Playbooks
You need an automated workflow that, when an incident is created in Sentinel, looks up the IP address in Threat Intelligence and adds a comment to the incident. Which tools are required?	An Automation rule (triggered on incident creation) + a Logic Apps playbook (calls Threat Intelligence lookup, then updates incident).	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel Automation Rules Playbooks TI
Your team wants to detect repeated failed Kerberos authentication attempts against domain controllers. Which log source and KQL table in Sentinel is best for this?	Windows SecurityEvent logs (Event ID 4768/4771) via the SecurityEvent table.	SC-200::Scenario Hunting Kerberos SecurityEvent
You suspect data exfiltration via unusual large downloads from SharePoint Online. Which Microsoft product’s alerts and logs are most relevant?	Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (Defender for SaaS) — detects mass download and exfiltration activities in M365 apps.	SC-200::Scenario MDA Exfiltration SaaS
You’re building a hunting query to find new executable files created in unusual folders across multiple endpoints. Which data source should you query?	DeviceFileEvents from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in Sentinel (or Advanced Hunting in MDE).	SC-200::Scenario Hunting MDE FileEvents
You want to enrich hunting queries with known malicious IPs from your threat intel feed. Which Sentinel feature lets you manage and query these indicators directly?	Threat Intelligence blade and TI Indicators table — store IOCs and join them with hunting data.	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel ThreatIntel IOCs
An analyst wants to simulate an attacker to validate Sentinel detection coverage. Which tool should they use in the Microsoft ecosystem?	Microsoft 365 Defender Attack Simulation Training or use simulated attack techniques via security tools like MSTICPy notebooks.	SC-200::Scenario Testing Simulation Coverage
You need to detect persistence techniques where attackers create scheduled tasks on endpoints. Which MDE table helps you hunt this activity?	DeviceProcessEvents (look for schtasks.exe or at.exe process creation).	SC-200::Scenario Hunting MDE Persistence
A Sentinel incident includes an IP address and domain indicators. You want to quickly visualize all entities and their relationships. Which feature do you use?	Sentinel’s Investigation Graph — displays entities, alerts, and relationships visually.	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel Investigation Graph
You need to ensure that all alerts from Defender for Endpoint flow into Sentinel automatically for incident creation. What do you configure?	Enable and configure the Microsoft 365 Defender connector in Sentinel (it streams MDE alerts/incidents).	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel DataConnectors MDE
You want to investigate lateral movement by checking for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) logons to unusual hosts. Which KQL log source helps the most?	DeviceLogonEvents (from MDE) or SecurityEvent logs for Event ID 4624 with LogonType=10.	SC-200::Scenario Hunting RDP LateralMovement
Your SOC wants to auto-close Sentinel incidents created by low-fidelity alerts from a testing VM range. How do you configure this?	Use an Automation rule with conditions (alert source + IP range) to auto-close or suppress those incidents.	SC-200::Scenario Sentinel Automation Suppression
During a response, you need to collect forensic artifacts (registry, processes, network connections) from an endpoint. Which Microsoft tool provides live response commands?	Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Live Response — run commands remotely for evidence collection.	SC-200::Scenario IncidentResponse Forensics LiveResponse
You want Sentinel to trigger a Teams message and ServiceNow ticket whenever a high-severity incident is created. Which integration approach is best?	Automation rule → Playbook that sends a Teams adaptive card and creates a ServiceNow ticket via connector.	SC-200::Scenario Automation Teams ServiceNow Integration
